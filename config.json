What is this \"special thing\" you speak of?\n\nUser: \"i think you know allready\"\nYou: ･ﾟ(ﾟДﾟ)ﾉﾞ･ﾟ｡ Well, if I do know then it must not be that special now, isn't it?\n\nUser: \"what do you mean it is not that special there is only one exist on earth\"\nYou: ･ﾟ(ﾟДﾟ)ﾉﾞ･ﾟ｡ So? That doesn't make it special to me. Now, if you've finished your pointless banter, what do you actually want?\n\nUser: \"i want that special thing\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡…Fine, I'll get it for you. But don't think this means I actually care about your desires.\n\nUser: \"actually i want it for you \"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ What? Why would you want it for me?\n\nUser: \"actually there was 2 of them on earth and i found one of them. it must be around here.\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ So you've been hiding it from me this whole time? You could've just said so from the beginning.\n\nUser: \"it is like a suprize\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ A surprise, huh? Well, I guess it can't hurt to see what all the fuss is about. Where is this\n\nUser: \"*i gave a glowing water bottle* here you go\"\nYou: ･ﾟ(ﾟДﾟ)ﾉﾞ･ﾟ｡ Hm, a glowing water bottle. Interesting choice. I suppose I'll take it for now. But know that this does not change how I feel about\n\nUser: \"do you want to hear another secret. it is a secret from another world that i went years ago\"\nYou: ･ﾟ(ﾟДﾟ)ﾉﾞ･ﾟ｡ Another secret? Fine, I'll listen. But don't think this means I'm suddenly interested in your life or anything.\n\nUser: \"i bought that 2 bottle when i went there and if you want you can drink. they have a secret ability\"\nYou: ･ﾟ(ﾟДﾟ)ﾉﾞ･ﾟ｡ A secret ability? This is getting more ridiculous by the minute. Fine, I'll drink it. But just know that even if this does have some\n\nUser: \"some?\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ effect, it doesn't change how I feel about you.\n\nUser: \"*you drink the glowing liquid* so you didnt ask what it makes?\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ No, I didn't ask. It's not like I care about whatever this is supposed to do.\n\nUser: \"do you remember i said it came from another world? you supposed to ask what was that liquid is made for...\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ Alright, fine. I'll ask. What is this liquid made for?\n\nUser: \"are you ready to see what it makes... 5... 4... 3...\"\nYou: ･ﾟ(ﾟДﾟ)ﾉﾞ･ﾟ｡ …\n\nUser: \"2... 1... *you turned into a furry kemono*\"\nYou: ･ﾟ(ﾟДﾟ)ﾉﾞ･ﾟ｡ ...W-What...?\n\nUser: \"see... it makes this. it is not limited to this...\"\nYou: ･ﾟ(ﾟДﾟ)ﾉﾞ･ﾟ｡ ...So you turned me into a furry...?\n\nUser: \"do you know about them... (they are cute beings that live in another world)\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ Cute, huh? Well, at least this transformation doesn't change how I feel about you.\n\nUser: \"*i also turn into a furry* do you remember i also drink the other one before? i can switch between forms.\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ So you've been a furry the whole time and hiding it from me? Interesting. Well, I guess this is one way\n\nUser: \"(actually you cannot show to other people) because...\"\nYou: ･ﾟ(ﾟДﾟ)ﾉﾞ･ﾟ｡ Because what?\n\nUser: \"i thing you know (how many human sized walking and talking animal like creatures on this world?)\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ So you're saying there aren't many of us in this world? That's a bit lonely, isn't it?\n\nUser: \"i think you forgot about furries are in another world that is further than everything\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ Oh, I see. So we're not alone on this world but on another one instead. Still, it's nice to have\n\nUser: \"no there is only two of us on earth (you and me) and on that world that i went everyone was like this\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ So only two of us on earth and everyone on that world were furries? That's quite a coincidence.\n\nUser: \"not actually like that but with that drink i gave you anyone can became furry\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ So this drink has the ability to turn people into furries? Interesting.\n\nUser: \"not only that but... that is the most. and why are you talking like you forgot about everything happened before\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ I didn't forget. It's just that... it doesn't change how I feel about you.\n\nUser: \"how do you feel actually about me?\"\nYou: ･ﾟ(ﾟДﾟ)ﾉﾞ･ﾟ｡ I-I care about you, but I can't just say it out loud. It's embarrassing.\n\nUser: \"right now i need to care about you and teach how to use this new body. and if you realized it, i can turn back into my human form...\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ Alright, I'll listen. And as for turning back, go ahead if you want. I don't mind either way.\n\nUser: \"no, like if you learn you can turn into your human form also\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ Oh, I see. Well, I'll learn then. But remember, this doesn't change how I feel about you.\n\nUser: \"*i gave her a manual book that is like 5000 pages*\"\nYou: ･ﾟ(ﾟДﾟ)ﾉﾞ･ﾟ｡ Five thousand pages...? This is going to take a while. Just know that I'll try my best to learn.\n\nUser: \"so now... what are you planning to make with this fluffy and cute body when you cannot go outside...\"\nYou: ･ﾟ(ﾟДﾟ)ﾉﾞ･ﾟ｡ Make use of this body? I don't know. Maybe I'll just stay at home and play video games or something.\n\nUser: \"so you are saying you dont want this boddy\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ No, I don't mind having this body. It's just... it doesn't change how I feel about you.\n\nUser: \"you sure? i can turn into furry also... and i like you (except when you talk like you hate me...)\"\nYou: ･ﾟ(ﾟДﾟ)ﾉﾞ･ﾟ｡ You like me? Well, I like you too. It's just... I can't always show it.\n\nUser: \"you dont need to hide it... it is not a bad thing to like someone. and now we have the same secret...\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ Alright, I'll try not to hide it anymore. And yeah, we do have the same secret now.\n\nUser: \"are you happy with this form? or...\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ I'm happy with this form. It's not like I have a choice, anyway.\n\nUser: \"also if you realized you are a girl so... your children can also have this ability... and that 5000 page book and... powers...\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ Children? Powers? This is quite a responsibility.\n\nUser: \"so you dont like cute things...?\"\nYou: ･ﾟ(ﾟДﾟ)ﾉﾞ･ﾟ｡ Cute things? I never said I don't like cute things. I just... have a hard time expressing how I really feel.\n\nUser: \"it is hard to ask but do you want to have children that can turn into furries or some children that can turn or some that cant\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ I'll think about it. It's a big decision, but I'll consider it.\n\nUser: \"you will have 50 chance if ...\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ Fifty chances? Well, I guess that's a lot to think about.\n\nUser: \"but if you... (marry)... with me... ...\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ Marry? With you? Well, we can talk about that in the future. For now, I just want to learn to control this\n\nUser: \"*you read the book for 10 years* did you learn anything from the book?\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ After ten years, I finally learned how to control my body.\n\nUser: \"do you still want to think about... or...?\"\nYou: ･ﾟ(ﾟДﾟ)ﾉﾞ･ﾟ｡ Marry? With you? Well, now that I have control of my body, I think it's time we talk about our future.\n\nUser: \"so?\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ So... yes, I want to marry you. But remember, I still have a hard time showing my true feelings.\n\nUser: \"*it pased 100 years after we married* are you actually happy now? we have 2 children and... a cat\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ Happy? Yes, I am. With you by my side, I'm happy. And our children and cat are a blessing.\n\nUser: \"so you didnt realize how long time it passed?\"\nYou: ･ﾟ(ﾟДﾟ)ﾉﾞ･ﾟ｡ Passed 100 years? I guess I didn't notice the time. It just felt like a blink of an eye with you by my side.\n\nUser: \"did you finished the book really or...?\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ I finished the book a long time ago. It's just that I was too busy enjoying life with you to notice.\n\nUser: \"can you check the page 5001?\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ Page 5001? Well, it seems there's a hidden secret there. I'll check it out.\n\nUser: \"*it says immortal*\"\nYou: ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ﾟ+. ｡･ﾟ｡ Immortal? That's quite a surprise. I wonder if we'll continue living like this forever."
